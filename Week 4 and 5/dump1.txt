First off, I strongly recommend following my account because otherwise you might miss out on the high-quality intellectually enlightened thought-provoking content that I bring upon this god-forsaken website. I graduated Harvard in 2014 and I have an IQ of 138 (on the Stanford-Binet scale).

Feel free to leave a comment, but beware; not only will your comment likely be removed for your lack of Redditorial prowess, but you will also be down-voted and reported to reddit.com. I will go through your account and down-vote everything. I don't think that will be quite enough to teach you to respect others, but at least it's a starting point.

You will only be humiliating yourself for trying (and failing) to debate me. But of course you will, that's all you Redditors ever do. Be another faceless pawn in the checkers game that is life! Guess whatâ€™s going to come of this? Nothing. Because all you do is complain on this website. A bunch of whiners who have such fragile enough egos that another's intelligence threatens you. I guess the fragile always need a target to release their frustrations.

So all it comes down to is the fragility of your ego, and discrimination against me. I hope it at least makes you happy, although I doubt it will, because from experience your bunch will find reason to complain about absolutely anything. Try to gaslight me; I'm ready.

Regards,

Elne

Shut your bitch ass up nerd.
Sure, I'm a bully. Sure, I call people angry nerds. 
What are you going to do about it? I mean honestly? Cry? 
Complain on a post that you didn't have to watch? 
Try to take the moral high ground? Who fucking cares? 
You're going to die, just like I'M going to die, just like angry Minecraft nerd is going to die, 
and you know what we leave behind? Nothing,
you're LUCKY if you end up as nothing but a hint on someone's ancestry.com account.
Get over yourself, because you seem insufferable and everyone in your life is more than likely WAY over you. 
Either wipe your tears and stop crying on posts you don't like, or crawl into a hole and die. 
I promise whatever happens to you won't affect my life, or even 99.999999% of the earth's population.
I'm going to continue eating food, pooping that food, sleeping and waking up to do it all again.
